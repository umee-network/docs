# What is a Blockchain?

![](/bg/what-is-a-blockchain-info.png)

A blockchain is a specific type of database that is coordinated and distributed across an open and public network of computer systems, with an ever-growing digital list of data points connected to one another acting as a decentralized public ledger.

The data that is added over time are structures called "blocks." Blocks build on top of each other in chronological order and include a piece of information that links each data block to the previous block, creating a verifiable chain all the way back to the genesis block (the first block). Blockchain is the core underlying component of [crypto](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-crypto).

Blockchain is considered one of the most disruptive technologies because its decentralized and trustless nature ensures that the truth of a state (facts, data, financial balances) is kept and maintained without relying on any centralized third party (centralized databases, financial institutions, or any authorities) and can be openly accessed by anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world.

## Characteristics of Blockchains

::: tab Decentralized

### Decentralized

****

Blockchains run on **decentralized** networks, meaning that transactions on each block are recorded across many computers world wide to ensure that the data cannot be altered. If the data were to be altered it would retroactively alter all subsequent blocks through a cryptographic function called "_hashing_" which would be impossible to implement in the current world.

::: tab Trustless

### Trustless

****

Blockchains utilize a **trustless** system, meaning that users do not need to know or trust each other or a third party for the source of truth in order for the system to function. In a trustless system, no single entity has authority over the system.

::: tab Accessible

### Accessible

****

Blockchains allow anyone with an internet connection to **access** markets and applications without any identification barriers that some may face with centralized financial institutions. This makes it much easier for two parties to transact without the need for a trusted third party like a bank.

::: tab Transparent

### Transparent

****

The **transparency** provided by blockchains benefits both regulators and companies; it simplifies and improves auditing processes for enterprises and provides permanent records of all transactions. Anybody can gain access to all transactional data from a blockchain.

::: tab Self-Sovereign

### Self-Sovereign

****

Lastly, **self-sovereignty** is a distinct property in crypto. Crypto users maintain full ownership and control over things that belong to them, be it data, money, or access to services. In the traditional world, we are used to giving control to third party softwares to store and access our data, and we rely on third party intermediaries such as banks to facilitate transactions.&#x20;

In crypto, the underlying blockchain technology gives full sovereignty to the individuals and each individual is able to make the usual activities in a peer to peer or peer to protocol fashion facilitated by algorithms and smart contract code instead of a centralized intermediary, hence the popular meme “_be your own bank_.”
