# Types of Blockchains

The most common blockchains utilize **Proof of Stake** or **Proof of Work** consensus mechanisms. A consensus mechanism is a procedure network participants follow in order to verify that the state of the data being transmitted on the network is correct. [Blockchains](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain) use consensus mechanisms to ensure that all network participants are in agreement on the data (transactions) being published on the decentralized public ledger. This is what enables [crypto](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-crypto) users to seamlessly transact without the need for a centralized authority.

> Umee is a Proof of Stake blockchain. Other well known Proof of Stake blockchains include Cosmos Hub, Solana, Polkadot, and Cardano.

Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains require network participants called "[validators](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator)" to lock up crypto as collateral to ensure that they properly “_validate_” the data being included in a new entry on the distributed ledger. Validators are randomly selected to validate a block based on the amount of collateral they have locked up, or “[staked](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-staking),” hence the name “Proof of Stake.” Once a randomly selected validator validates a block, other validators verify its accuracy and the "_block rewards_," or newly minted units of crypto, are released.

> PoS blockchains limit the amount of validators that can take turns creating new blocks, making it faster and cheaper to reach a consensus. [Users of PoS blockchains like Umee](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet) typically enjoy cheap, near-instant transactions.

> There is typically a limit to the amount of validators that can participate in a blockchain’s PoS consensus. Since validators are chosen randomly, they do not need to compete and use large amounts of energy to create new blocks, which is why newer PoS blockchains like Umee are viewed as an environmentally-friendly solution.

## Proof of Work

****

> Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well known blockchains that use a Proof of Work consensus protocol.

Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains require network participants called “miners” to compete to solve a mathematical puzzle in order to create a new "_block_" or data entry to the decentralized public ledger. It takes a lot of work in order to solve the puzzle, hence the name “Proof of Work.” Once a new block has been created, other network participants must verify its accuracy in order to add it to the ledger, at which point the participant who proposed the block earns “block rewards,” or newly minted units of cryptocurrency issued to network participants in return for their role in securing the network.

> PoW blockchains allow an unlimited number of network participants to compete against one another to create new blocks, and the equipment and energy used can be costly. These costs are often imposed on users through expensive transaction fees and slower transactions.

> Since there is no limit to the amount of miners that can participate in PoW consensus, and the immense amount of computing power needed to create a new block on a PoW blockchain requires large amounts of energy, popular PoW blockchains like the Bitcoin network are often viewed as harmful to the environment.
