# Why Does Crypto Exist?

While many popular centralized payment services like bank transfers, Venmo, Cash App, and PayPal allow users to exchange funds, they are not permissionless, censorship resistant, or convenient for all users.&#x20;

### Permissionless

****

**With centralized services** users must be granted permission in order to use them. Sign ups require a "KYC" process in which users typically provide a government issued ID and personal information in order to be approved. If the services want to, or are ordered to, they have the ability to block transactions or freeze accounts at any time.

**With crypto** users are able to transact with one another freely. No centralized intermediary can prevent the transfer of funds or freeze a user's account.

### Censorship Resistant

****

**With centralized services** many people may are unable access basic financial tools due to things like their physical location or background.

**With crypto**, anyone with an internet connection can access a decentralized network and transact as they'd like.

### Convenient

****

**With centralized services** transactions are often slow and expensive for users.

**With crypto,** funds can be transferred instantly with near zero transaction costs for users.
