> [Umee blockchain compatible wallets](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) like Keplr are interchain wallets, meaning they can also be used as wallets for other blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond.

## Changing Networks

> Changing networks within a wallet extension allows users to view their wallet addresses, token balances, and send or receive tokens. Users do not need to manually change the network when interacting with the Umee web app.

#### 3) Paste the wallet address you are sending tokens to.

> This wallet address must be associated with an account on the same network. If you're sending tokens on the Umee network, the wallet address will start with "umee."

> It's very important to confirm the receiving address before sending tokens. Transactions are irreversible.

#### 4) Select the dropdown and choose which token you'd like to send.

> Tokens will be received on the same network they are sent from, regardless of the type of token being sent.

![For this example we will be sending native UMEE tokens, so "UMEE" is selected.](/bg/send-tokens-4.png)

#### 5) Input the amount of tokens you'd like to send.

> If you're sending native tokens used for gas, don't forget to keep some to cover the transaction fee.

#### 6) Input a transaction memo if desired.

> A memo is a brief message that accompanies the transaction, and is optional for most transactions. Memos can be useful to help users stay organized.

> All memos are public and can be viewed by anyone on the blockchain.

> Centralized exchanges will often require a memo so they know which account to credit when tokens are deposited. Familiarize yourself with the practices of your centralized exchange of choice before depositing tokens.

#### You have now sent tokens from your crypto wallet!

> Transactions on the Umee blockchain usually process within a few seconds.

> Centralized exchanges may take a while to process incoming transactions. Please be patient and do not panic if your tokens do not arrive immediately. Contact the support team at your centralized exchange of choice if you have any questions.
