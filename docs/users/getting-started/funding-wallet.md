## Withdrawing Native UMEE 

> [Confirm your UMEE tokens are in their native format before funding your wallet](/overview/umee-token/token-format).

> If your exchange of choice doesn't support the native UMEE token, skip to the ["Withdrawing Native ATOM" guide](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet.html#withdrawing-native-atom).

#### 1) Select the withdraw option for the UMEE token on your centralized exchange of choice.

#### 2) Open your Umee wallet extension, select "Umee" from the network dropdown list, and copy your Umee wallet address.

#### 3) Select "Withdraw," paste your Umee wallet address in the "withdraw to" section, and wait for the transaction to process. Your UMEE will appear on the Umee network in your [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) shortly.

> Please note that withdrawing from a CEX may take longer than normal transactions on the Umee network. Don't panic if your tokens do not appear instantly. Purchase ATOM from your CEX of choice.

## Withdrawing Native ATOM

> Purchasing and withdrawing ATOM, the native Cosmos Hub token, is one of the easiest ways to start using the [Cosmos ecosystem](/users/blockchai-basics/what-is-cosmos). These tokens can easily be [exchanged for native UMEE tokens](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet.html#trading-cosmos-assets-on-a-decentralized-exchange).
