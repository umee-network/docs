#### Select if you’d prefer a 12 or 24 word secret recovery phrase, and write it down.

> It's very important that you safely store and never share your secret recovery phrase! This is the only backup to your wallet in the event your device is lost or destroyed. Failure to properly store and conceal your secret recovery phrase will most likely result in the loss of assets stored in your wallet.
