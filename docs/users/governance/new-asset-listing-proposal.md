# Creating a New Asset Listing Proposal

UX allows users to lend and borrow a wide variety of assets across chains in a trustless manner. UX follows a formal listing process that allows the protocol to [assess risk using a targeted framework](/governance/asset-listing/risk-assessment-methodology) that scrutinizes key risk areas including market risk (volume, volatility, market cap), centralization of asset, protocol risk, etc.

Anyone can submit a proposal for a new asset to be listed on UX by creating a "New Asset Listing Proposal" thread on [UX's governance forum](https://gov.umee.cc/). An off-chain poll is used to gauge community sentiment around a New Asset Listing Proposal, and the UX Core team will submit an on-chain "Token Registry Proposal" for assets that gain clear support.

While all assets that are accepted by UX's governance will be listed on UX, different assets have different levels of risk that will be assessed by a risk team. Proposers should provide as much of the relevant information as possible to help UX make an informed decision.

> If there is clear support for the proposal on UX's governance forum, an UX core team member will create and submit an on-chain "Token Registry Proposal" to add support for the asset on UX as soon as possible. Nothing more is needed from the proposer.
