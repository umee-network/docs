#### 5) Read the description of the governance proposal and do additional research as needed before making a decision. When you're ready, select the "Vote" button.

> If you're unsure which way to vote, take your time to decide. You have until the "Voting End" deadline to cast your vote.

#### 6) Choose which way you would like to cast your vote, select "Confirm," and approve the vote in your wallet.

| Option |  Implication  |
|:--------:| -------------------------------------------------- |
|   Yes   | The voter approves the proposal in its existing form. |
|    No   | The voter does not approve the proposal in its existing form.|
|NoWithVeto| The voter strongly disagrees with the proposal and feels the deposits made should be burned. Community members should use “NoWithVeto” when they determine a proposal is spam, or harmful to the Umee Hub.|
| Abstain | The voter has no preference on the outcome of the vote, but has still participated in the voting process.|

#### You have now cast your vote and successfully participated in Umee protocol governance!
