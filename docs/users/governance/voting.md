| :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Yes     | The voter approves the proposal in its existing form.                                                                                                                                                      |
|     No     | The voter does not approve the proposal in its existing form.                                                                                                                                              |
| NoWithVeto | The voter strongly disagrees with the proposal and feels the deposits made should be burned. Community members should use “NoWithVeto” when they determine a proposal is spam, or harmful to the Umee Hub. |
|  Abstain   | The voter has no preference on the outcome of the vote, but has still participated in the voting process.                                                                                                  |
