## Step 1: Discussion

It’s very important for community members to discuss their ideas and receive thorough feedback before starting the proposal process. Community members are encouraged to use Umee community channels to discuss early stage governance ideas including the "General" channel on [Umee's Governance forum](https://gov.umee.cc/discussions/General). Always use the "**General**" topic and the “**Discussion**” stage tag when sharing ideas to help keep the forum organized.

#### Some things to take into consideration include:

* How will this proposal bring value to the Umee community?
* Are there any significant risks or tradeoffs associated with this idea?
* Which stakeholders will be impacted the most if this proposal is implemented?
* Is there clear community demand for this proposal?

## Step 2: Draft the Proposal

Community members should take any and all feedback and suggestions into consideration when drafting a proposal. It’s important to anticipate which questions other community members may ask when drafting a proposal, and try to include details to address them in advance. Once the proposal has been drafted, it’s time to post it with the "**Proposal Discussion**" topic on [Umee's governance forum](https://gov.umee.cc/).

#### When posting a drafted proposal:

* Include a short title that summarizes the content;
* Always use the “**Drafted: Pre-Voting**” stage tag to help keep the forum organized;
* Include an off-chain poll to help gauge sentiment.

### Sharing a Drafted Proposal

## Step 3: Engage With the Community

Once the drafted proposal has been shared on Commonwealth, the author should:

* Encourage key community members (well respected contributors, validators, large stakers, etc.) to share their questions, concerns and/or constructive criticism.
* Spread the word to bring attention to the proposal. Use tools like Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and Reddit to alert the community.
* Answer relevant questions on Commonwealth and the #governance-discussion channel on the [Umee Discord](https://discord.gg/umee).

If the community’s feedback and off-chain poll demonstrate clear support for the governance proposal, the author should make any necessary changes and prepare to submit the proposal on-chain.

## Step 4: Submit the On-Chain Proposal

Once there has been ample discussion and all feedback has been taken into consideration, the governance proposal should be submitted on-chain.

> Please note that a 10,000 UMEE deposit is required for all on-chain governance proposals and is fully refundable as long as the according proposal reaches the quorum and is not deemed malicious and therefore vetoed. The full amount does not need to come from the proposer but from any supporters who are willing to give support.

#### When submitting an on-chain proposal:

* Pay close attention to fine details - once a proposal has been submitted on chain it cannot be altered;
* Include the links to any relevant discussions that have already taken place;
* Update the tag on the edited draft from “Drafted: Pre-Voting” to “**On Chain Proposal**” to help keep the forum organized.

### Creating an On-Chain Proposal

#### 1) Select the New thread button and choose "New On-Chain Proposal" from the dropdown.
