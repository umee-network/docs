# Selecting a Validator

![](../.gitbook/assets/Selecting-a-Validator02.jpg)

**Validators play a critical role in maintaining a decentralized and secure network. Get to know validators before staking your tokens with them.**

{% tab title="Voting Power & Participation" %}
### Voting Power

A validator's voting power represents the sum of tokens that are self-bonded and delegated to the validator. When a community member fails to [<mark style="color:blue;">vote on a governance proposal</mark>](../governance/voting.md), the validator they have delegated their stake to will inherit their vote.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_**In order to support the decentralization and security of the Umee network, it's important that voting power is evenly distributed between validators. Community members are encouraged to delegate to validators who hold less voting power - often found outside the top 25.**_
{% endhint %}



### Participation

Active governance is important for the growth of the network. Validators have a responsibility to actively participate in governance, and vote in the interests of their delegators. Community members should delegate to validators who actively participate in governance.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**It's important to delegate to a validator that actively participates in governance and shares a similar outlook as you, so you can count on them to vote in your best interest if you ever fail to vote on time.**_
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Uptime " %}
### Uptime

Uptime represents the validator's reliability. Validators with significant downtime may be jailed and potentially removed from the active set, resulting in the slashing of their stake.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Community members should only delegate to validators with a high uptime percentage.**_
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Commission" %}
### Commission

A validator's commission is the percent of staking rewards that a validator will keep for the services provided. It's not cheap or easy to run an Umee validator node, so it's important that validators earn a commission for their services.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Between 2% & 10% is typically a fair commission rate for the services provided.**_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Validator commissions can be changed over time. Delegators should consider familiarizing themselves with a validator's max rate (maximum commission that can be charged) and max rate change (maximum amount a validator's commission rate can change in 24 hours) before delegating.**_
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Self Bond " %}
### Self Bond

A validator's self bonded percentage represents the amount of tokens a validator has delegated to themselves. This is a good indicator of whether a validator has "skin in the game" or not.
