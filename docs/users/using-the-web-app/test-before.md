# Test Before You Try

![](/bg/test-before-try.png)

Crypto can be scary for new users. While crypto allows users to be in full control of their assets and transact in a trustless manner, transactions are irreversible so mistakes can be costly.

Umee aims to make DeFi as easy and accessible as possible, and encourages new users to test out features on [Umee's testnet](https://testnet.umee.cc/) **before using real money.**

<br>

## What is a Testnet?

A **testnet** is a network identical to the main network that is used for testing and experimentation without the use of real funds. Crypto developers commonly use testnets to try out new products and features before deploying them on the main network. Crypto users can use testnets to familiarize themselves with how products or services work before using real assets.

Testnets use testnet tokens, valueless versions of real tokens that help simulate how interactions occur on mainnet. From a user perspective there is no difference between testnet and mainnet when interacting with an individual application. Many projects do not maintain a testnet, so users may not be able to seamlessly transfer funds across different test networks as they would on mainnet.

<br>

## Who Should Use a Testnet?

- Anyone who is brand new to crypto should try out Umee's testnet before using mainnet.

- Users who are familiar with crypto but have never used a money market protocol are also encouraged to try out Umee's testnet before using mainnet.

## How To Use The Testnet

**All of the guides provided in this "Using the Web App" section will work on both Umee's testnet and mainnet.**

> Umee's testnet web app can be accessed at [testnet.umee.cc](https://testnet.umee.cc/)

> Unlike Umee's main network, Umee's test network will not appear in your [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) by default. In order to add test networks to your wallet you will need to go to [testnet.umee.cc](https://testnet.umee.cc/) and follow the instructions found in "[Connecting to the App](/users/using-the-web-app/connecting-app)."

### Claiming Testnet UMEE 

****

> In order to try out Umee's testnet users will need testnet UMEE tokens. Testnet UMEE tokens are simply a valueless version of [native UMEE tokens](/overview/umee-token) that are needed to pay for transaction costs on Umee's testnet. Testnet tokens can be claimed for free on [Umee's Discord server](https://discord.gg/umee).

<br>

#### Open your [Umee wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) browser extension and select the network dropdown list. Choose "UMEE Umeemania" from the dropdown.

#### Use a public Goerli ETH faucet to claim testnet ETH for free.

> Umee does not provide a Goerli ETH faucet. Please be respectful and only claim the Goerli ETH that you need to transact on Umee's Ethereum testnet app.

> Depending on the faucet being used, users may be asked to perform various steps to prove they are not a bot.

[Main Goerli Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

[Slock's Goerli Faucet](https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/)

[Mudit's Goerli Faucet](https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/)
