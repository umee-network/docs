# Transferring Tokens

![](/bg/transferring-tokens.png)

Umee supports lending and borrowing on the Umee and Ethereum networks, and plans to support several other chains in the future.

> Use the "Cosmos Transfers" guide to easily transfer supported Cosmos assets like ATOM to Umee. This is the fastest, easiest, and most cost efficient method.

> Use the "Ethereum --> Umee Transfers" guide to convert assets from their Ethereum format to their Cosmos format.

> Use the "Umee --> Ethereum Transfers" guide to convert assets from their Cosmos format to their Ethereum format.

## Cosmos Transfers

If you have Cosmos assets like ATOM on a different network in your Umee blockchain compatible wallet, follow this guide to transfer them to Umee.

> Cosmos transfers only require an [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) like Keplr.

> Prerequisites
>
> * [Must have an Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet)
> * [Must have UMEE tokens to transact on the Umee blockchain](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet)
> * Must have [Cosmos assets like ATOM](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet.html#withdrawing-native-cosmos-tokens) to transfer to or from Umee.

### Written Guide

****

#### 1) Make sure your [Umee wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) and the wallet you're transferring from are [connected to the web app](/users/using-the-web-app/connecting-app).

#### 2) On the "Markets" page, select "Cosmos."

> When "Cosmos" is selected tokens will be transferred between their native chains and the Umee blockchain, with the exception of native UMEE tokens which are already on the Umee blockchain.

#### 3) Identify which asset you’d like to transfer on to Umee and select “Transfer” in the appropriate row.

#### 4) Select which network you'd like to transfer _**to**_ on the top of the pop-up.

> To transfer assets off of Umee and back to their native chain, simply select the destination chain here.

![We will be selecting "UMEE" since we are transferring ATOM onto the Umee blockchain.](/bg/ibc-3.png)

#### 5) In the pop-up, input the amount of tokens you’d like to transfer, select “Transfer,” and approve the transaction in your wallet.

#### After tokens have been transferred to Umee, users can [supply them on the Umee market](/users/using-the-web-app/supply-withdraw) to start earning lending interest.

## Ethereum to Umee Transfers

If you are in possession of ERC-20 UMEE, or if you'd like to access native Ethereum assets while enjoying Umee's fast and inexpensive transactions, use this guide to bridge ERC-20 assets to Umee.

> Prerequisites (Umee <> Ethereum)
>
> * [Must have an Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet)
> * Must have an Ethereum wallet (e.g. MetaMask)
> * [Must have an UMEE balance to pay for transactions on Umee](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet)
> * Must have an ETH balance to pay for transactions on Ethereum.

### Written Guide

****

#### 1) Make sure your [Umee wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) and Ethereum wallet are both [connected to the web app](/users/using-the-web-app/connecting-app).

#### 2) On the top of the markets page, select "Ethereum."

#### 3) Identify which asset you’d like to transfer, and select the “Transfer” button in the appropriate row.

#### 4) On the top of the pop-up, select "Umee."

> This will indicate that you're transferring tokens TO Umee.

#### 5) Input the amount of tokens you'd like to transfer.

#### 6) Confirm that the Umee destination wallet address is correct. If you're transferring an asset that's not UMEE, make sure you have an UMEE token balance in your Umee wallet to pay for transactions on the Umee network.

#### 7) Select "Transfer" and confirm the transaction in your Ethereum wallet.

> Transfers between Umee and Ethereum may take significantly longer than Cosmos transfers to process.

## Umee to Ethereum Transfers

> _**UMEE tokens that are bridged to Ethereum cannot be used to pay for gas fees on the Umee network, staked to earn staking yield, or used to participate in governance.**_

> _**Transactions on Ethereum may be significantly slower and more expensive than transactions on the Umee blockchain. Make sure you have an ETH balance in your Ethereum wallet before transferring tokens to Ethereum.**_

> ### _**Prerequisites (Umee <> Ethereum)**_

#### 7) Adjust the bridge fee as desired.

> When bridging from Umee to Ethereum the "Fast" option is recommended.

> Using low fees while bridging from Umee to Ethereum may result in extended wait times.
