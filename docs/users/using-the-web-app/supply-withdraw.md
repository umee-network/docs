# Supplying & Withdrawing

## Supplying Assets

> After assets have been [transferred to Umee](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens) they can be supplied on the Umee Market to start earning [lending yield](/learn-the-basics/umee-basics/common-terms.html#supply-apr). Certain assets supplied on the Umee Market can be used as [collateral](/learn-the-basics/umee-basics/common-terms.html#collateral) for [cross chain borrowing](/users/using-the-web-app/borrow-repay).
