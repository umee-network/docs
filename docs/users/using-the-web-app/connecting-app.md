# Connecting to the App

> Once you have created an [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet), you will be able to connect it to Umee's web app and easily [transfer tokens onto Umee](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens).

## Connecting to the Umee Web App

#### 1) Go to [app.umee.cc](https://app.umee.cc/) (mainnet) or [testnet.umee.cc](https://testnet.umee.cc/) (testnet).

#### 2) You should now see a pop-up from your Umee blockchain compatible wallet. Approve the connection request to connect to your account on the Umee blockchain. *Testnet users will also be asked to approve a chain add request.*

> This will allow the Umee web app to know your wallet address and balances, and give the app the ability to request approval for transactions initiated by the user. This does NOT give the Umee web app the ability to spend tokens without permission.

#### If you do not see the pop-up, select the "Connect" button in the top right corner and approve the connection and chain add requests as necessary.

#### You have now connected your Umee wallet to the Umee web app. As you begin [transferring assets across chains](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens) you will be asked to approve connections for each individual chain.
