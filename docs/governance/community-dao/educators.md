# Educators

> TLDR: Educators are expected to create and distribute high quality educational content to help onboard the next generation of DeFi users to Umee.

<br>

## Overview

Create and share high quality educational content that is easily understandable and ENGAGING! Avoid creating unnecessarily long content if it can be condensed and shared in a shorter format. 

Educators are encouraged to focus on what they're good at, since quality is significantly more important than quantity. It's important to distribute educational content to the appropriate audience in order for it to be deemed valuable. Collaborate with your local community and the greater [Umee community on Discord](https://discord.gg/umee) in order to determine the most effective distribution methods.

> The purpose of educational content is to EDUCATE new and prospective users. Platforms like Medium will remove posts it determines to be advertisements or promotions.

### Tips

****

- Contributors who write about topics that interest them are more likely to create valuable content - DO NOT write solely in an effort to earn rewards;
- It's often better to focus on a specific topic in depth rather than trying to cover several topics at once;
- Identify the intended audience before writing, and break things down accordingly;
- Share the published content somewhere it will be seen by the intended audience;
- Consider utilizing whatever features are provided (bullets, italics, dropdowns, etc.) in an effort to make the content easier to read;
- Embedding relevant images and videos is a nice touch, just give credit wherever it's due;
- Avoid unnecessary repetition and condense content as much as possible - there is no word minimum;
- Incorporate links wherever necessary.
