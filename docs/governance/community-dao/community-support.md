# Community Support

> TLDR: Community Support leaders help organize, moderate, and support community members across all active Umee community channels.

<br>

## Overview

Identify underserved platforms and create and lead regional Umee Community channels. Coordinate with other contributors to avoid unnecessary work - there is no need to volunteer as a moderator on channels that are already well-covered or channels that don't have an active community.

When submitting your work, providing a link to the community channel is enough - please don't link individual messages.

### Tips

****

- Turn on post notifications for Umee's official channels so updates can be shared with your community in a timely manner;
- Use Umee's official channels as a source of truth - if you're unsure of the answer to a question, ask on [Umee's Discord]() instead of guessing.

## Creating New Channels

### Requirements

****

- Communicate with your local community to ensure there is clear demand for the channel before creating it - only channels that are actively used can be considered valuable;
- Disclose that it is a community-run channel and include links to official channels;
- Appoint at least one other trusted community member as an admin so the account does not rely entirely on a single contributor;
- Use a unique password and require 2fa for any admins;
- Be respectful and avoid spamming existing channels in an effort to grow the channel;
- Follow Umee's [branding guidelines](https://umee.cc/brand/).
