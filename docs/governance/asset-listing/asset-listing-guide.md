# New Asset Listing Guide

Umee allows users to lend and borrow a wide variety of assets across chains in a trustless manner. Umee follows a formal listing process that allows the protocol to assess risk using a targeted framework that scrutinizes key risk areas including market risk (volume, volatility, market cap), centralization of asset, protocol risk, etc. 

Anyone can submit a proposal for a new asset to be listed on Umee through Umee's governance. While all assets that are accepted by Umee's governance will be listed on Umee, different assets have different levels of risk that will be assessed by a risk team. Proposers should provide as much of the relevant information as possible to help Umee make an informed decision.

## 2) Submitting the Proposal

Once a new asset listing proposal has been created, it's time to [submit it as a text proposal](/users/governance/creating-proposal) through Umee's governance process. 

### To Submit a Text Proposal:

#### 1) Start by connecting your wallet to [Umee's governance forum](https://gov.umee.cc/).

#### 2) Select the New thread button and choose "New On-Chain Proposal" from the dropdown.

#### 4) Enter the proposal title in the following format:

> Listing Proposal: Add Support for {Asset Name}

#### 5) Paste the finalized proposal in the Description box.

> If a governance thread was created to discuss the New Asset Listing Proposal draft, include it as a link at the very bottom of the proposal.

#### 6) In the deposit section, input the amount of UMEE you'd like to contribute towards the minimum deposit threshold of 100,000 UMEE. Make note that the deposit is denominated in micro UMEEs, so users who wish to make the deposit in full should enter "100,000,000,000." 

Users are welcomed to [borrow UMEE](/users/using-the-web-app/borrow-repay) from the Umee market in order to make a deposit.

> Deposits will be fully refunded after the proposal has passed or failed assuming:
> - The minimum deposit of 100,000 UMEE is met within the 14 day deposit period;
> - At least 40% of eligible votes are cast and the proposal reaches quorom;
> - Less than 1/3 of the voting power votes "NoWithVeto."

#### 7) Select "Send Transaction" and approve the transaction from your Umee wallet.

#### 8) Once the New Asset Listing Proposal has been submitted on chain, spread the word to encourage community participation.
