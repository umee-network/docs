# What is a DeFi Money Market?

## What is a Money Market?

Borrowers use money markets to take out a short-term loan (typically under a year) to borrow a single currency (i.e USD), while at the same time putting up another currency (i.e. Euros) or an asset (i.e. real estate) as collateral. This collateral is required to help ensure the borrowerâ€™s debts are repaid in full; if the borrower fails to pay back their debts the collateral is sold to make the lender whole. Otherwise, the collateral is returned when the borrower pays off the loan plus interest.

In exchange for the ability to borrow working capital from lenders, borrowers are required to pay a fee, usually in the form of an annual interest rate (i.e. 7% a year), which generates yield for lenders and incentives deposits. This interest rate is typically a function of supply and demand to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for both borrowers and lenders. A high supply and low demand of an asset lead to lower interest rates, while a low supply and high demand lead to higher interest rates. Various money markets compete based on the interest rates they offer and other parameters such as how much collateral is required for loans.

While traditional money markets have been a net positive for the global economy over the centuries by enabling businesses to expand and allowing citizens to save their money, the money markets of today are typically operated by a centralized institution, granting a significant amount of power and influence over user funds to a single entity. This design increases costs for borrowers/lenders and requires a high degree of trust in a single party.

## What is a Decentralized Money Market?

In response to the limitations seen in traditional money markets, developers are now utilizing blockchain-based smart contracts to create decentralized money markets that operate as code on a highly decentralized network of nodes worldwide. Instead of being controlled by a centralized institution, decentralized money markets like Umee are operated through on-chain programmatic code that is upgraded and managed by a global community of stakeholders, decentralizing control and reducing points of failure. Below represent a few of the primary advantages decentralized money markets bring to consumers.

### Non-custodial

****

Decentralized money markets operate in a non-custodial manner where the original users can only withdraw deposited funds from borrowers and lenders. Instead of a centralized institution deciding where and how funds are used, decentralized money markets like Umee follow the predefined logic of on-chain smart contracts, granting a large degree of assurance that funds cannot be improperly used and ensuring that users keep full control over when and how they can withdraw.

### Permissionless

****

Through the use of smart contracts, on-chain money markets can operate in an inherently permissionless manner where users do not need to ask permission from a central gatekeeper. This enables anyone with access to the internet to earn yield and/or borrow working capital with minimal friction. This censorship resistance creates a wider market of users, including the underbanked, generating more economic activity and higher yields as a result.

Decentralized money markets allow users to put up crypto as collateral. This enables users to earn passive lending yield on their crypto while leveraging their crypto holdings.

Decentralized money markets have a unique advantage in that deposited funds can be tokenized. These tokenized deposits become interest-bearing representations of the underlying assets and can be used within other applications within the decentralized finance ecosystem. This is likely why decentralized money markets have become one of the most widely used applications in the DeFi economy, alongside decentralized exchanges and stablecoins.
