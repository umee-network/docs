Decentralized finance, or “DeFi,” is a term used to describe a wide range of decentralized financial services made possible by blockchain technology.

## Benefits of DeFi

Traditional financial services rely on intermediaries like banks to facilitate any and all transactions. These intermediaries have the power to dictate how and when users can access and use their own money.

Thanks to blockchain technology, DeFi allows users to “be their own bank.” When interacting with DeFi services users maintain full control over their assets without the need to trust a centralized intermediary.

Many people worldwide are unable to experience the benefits provided by traditional financial services for a wide range of reasons including but not limited to their location, level of income, or credit score.

Anyone with an internet connection can access DeFi services. Blockchain technology allows DeFi services to be completely permissionless, meaning users do not need to apply and be approved to gain access to financial services.

### Transparent

Traditional financial services typically give users little to no visibility on their processes.

On the blockchain everything is auditable and transparent. Users can know exactly what risks they are taking on when using any DeFi service. Additionally, users cannot be discriminated against; everyone can access the same opportunities and rates regardless of their financial background.

Traditional financial services can be slow, expensive, and inconvenient in general. Traditional financial service providers often tack on unnecessary fees for simple services that users have no choice but to pay.&#x20;

Since no intermediaries are needed in DeFi, financial services can be offered at a much lower cost for the user. Financial transactions are fast and simple, the way that they should be.
