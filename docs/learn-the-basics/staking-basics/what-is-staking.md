Staking is the safest and easiest way for crypto users to earn more crypto while contributing to the security of a network. [Proof of Stake blockchains](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/types-of-blockchains) like Umee require network participants called [validators](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator) to lock up [crypto](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-crypto) as collateral in order to be eligible to validate and add transaction data to the blockchain. Validators provide collateral to prove that they have a “_stake_” in the network and therefore can be trusted to help keep the blockchain operational and secure – or otherwise face a financial penalty. In return for their role in running and securing the network, validators are paid in newly minted units of crypto called “_block rewards_.”

> Block rewards are newly minted units of [crypto](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-crypto) that are issued to network participants in return for their role in running and securing a network. 

When a user [stakes their tokens](/users/staking-umee/staking-umee) on a blockchain like Umee they’re delegating them to a validator and therefore contributing to the validator’s total stake. When validators earn block rewards, the block rewards are redistributed to the users who have delegated to them in proportion to the amount they have delegated.

Staking rewards are considered the steadiest, lowest risk yield in crypto. [Validators](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator) earn block rewards according to the total amount of tokens they have staked, and these block rewards are typically redistributed to delegators proportional to the amount of tokens they have delegated. This allows users who are unable to operate a validator node to safely earn staking rewards while helping secure the network. In addition to earning staking yield and helping secure the blockchain, stakers are also able to [vote on governance proposals](/users/governance/voting) to help shape the future of the network.

### Risks?

****

Staked tokens are a form of collateral used to ensure [validators](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator) do their job. Therefore, if a validator misbehaves a portion of their total stake is removed or “_slashed_.” This means that everyone who has delegated tokens to this validator will have their tokens slashed proportionately. 

> Slashing is very rare because validators are financially incentivized to do their job. 

The most severe offense a validator can commit on the Umee blockchain results in 5% of their total stake being slashed, meaning that delegators would lose 5% of the tokens they delegated to this validator if the validator misbehaves.
