# Validators

## What is a Validator?

 **Validators** are network participants who verify transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain in order to ensure that a blockchain’s data isn’t corrupted. Proof of Stake blockchains like Umee rely on validators to keep the network operational, decentralized, and secure.

Validators operate “_validator nodes_,” devices that permit a blockchain to reach consensus in a decentralized manner and thus make up the foundation of a blockchain. Every validator node stores a copy of the data on the blockchain so there is no centralized point of failure.

## Validator Incentives

In order to run a validator node on a Proof of Stake blockchain, validators must provide a blockchain’s [native cryptocurrency](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/types-of-crypto) as collateral. Validators are selected to propose a new block (the new data to be added to a blockchain) based on the amount of collateral they post, which means that the validators with the most to lose have more influence than the validators with smaller stakes. When validators successfully add a new block to a blockchain they earn “_block rewards_,” or newly minted units of crypto used as an economic incentive to motivate validators to run and secure the decentralized network. 

In order to run a validator node on large blockchains a significant amount of collateral is required. Validators rarely post all of the collateral themselves, but rather work with a community of stakers to accumulate a large stake. When token holders on blockchains like Umee [stake their tokens](/users/staking-umee/staking-umee) they are “_delegating_” them to a validator, and thus contributing to the validator’s total stake. Delegating allows users who don’t know how to operate validator nodes to contribute to the security of a network and earn a portion of the block rewards. Stakers maintain custody over their tokens while they are delegated to a validator, and are free to unstake or redelegate to another validator at any time. When validators earn block rewards, the block rewards are typically redistributed to all of the users who contribute to their stake in proportion to the amount contributed. In return for the services provided, validators typically charge a small commission (5-10%) of staking rewards in order to fund their operations.

Since validators need to post significant collateral in order to participate in a blockchain’s consensus, they are financially incentivized to properly verify the data being added to the blockchain. Validators who fail to keep their validator nodes operational are penalized through “_slashing_” or having a portion of their total stake removed. Slashing rarely occurs since validators are financially incentivized to do their job.

## Validator Responsibilities

### Securing the Network

****

First and foremost, validators are responsible for maintaining an active node which helps commit new blocks to a blockchain. Validators must ensure that their nodes remain online at all times and function as intended in order for the network to run smoothly.

### Governing the Network

****

Strong active [governance](/governance/governance-overview) is crucial to the success of any network. As the industry continues to develop, changes need to be made in order for networks to adjust and grow. All [stakers](/users/staking-umee/staking-umee) have the ability to [vote on governance proposals](/users/governance/voting) to help shape the future of the network. While the democratization associated with blockchains provides an incredible opportunity for anyone to vote on various proposals, many users may not be familiar with issues at hand or have the time to regularly follow governance discussions.

> In the crypto world validators can be thought of as representatives/elected officials, and stakers as citizens who elect these representatives.

Stakers have a vested interest in the network, and are expected to delegate their stake to validators who will actively participate in governance and vote in their best interests. This way if a staker is uninformed on a specific governance topic, or fails to vote on time, his/her vote will be inherited by the validators he/she has delegated to. These validators have a responsibility to stay informed and actively vote in the interest of the community members who delegate to them.
