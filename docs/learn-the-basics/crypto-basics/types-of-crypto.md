# Types of Crypto

## Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are the most well-known type of crypto-asset. Cryptocurrencies are simply digital units of account intended to be used as traditional currencies are used: as a medium of transfer and/or a store of value.&#x20;

## Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a form of crypto-asset that are intended to allow users to enjoy the benefits of crypto and web3 without having to deal with the volatility commonly associated with other cryptos. Stablecoins achieve their price stability by being pegged to or backed by a commodity or fiat currency, or by using algorithmic economics to regulate supply and demand. Many popular stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, meaning that in theory they can always be redeemed by a user for $1 or $1 worth of another asset.

> Stablecoins can be classified based on their stability mechanism. The most common types of stablecoins are fiat-backed, commodity-backed, crypto-backed, and algorithmic.

### Fiat-Backed Stablecoins

****

Fiat-backed stablecoins aim to hold their pegs by maintaining reserves in fiat currencies. These stablecoins are commonly pegged to the US dollar due to its strength relative to other currencies.

##### Advantages

Fiat-backed stablecoins are a popular choice among DeFi users because they have faith that they can redeem one fiat-backed stablecoin for one physical unit of the currency it represents at any time.

##### Disadvantages

Centralized entities are needed to issue fiat-backed stablecoins and manage the reserves. This means that a fiat-backed stablecoin is only as good as the organization that issues it. These organizations may be targeted by authorities who wish to maintain full control over a currency, and/or be subject to banking regulations which other stablecoins may not be.

##### Examples

_USDT, USDC, BUSD, TUSD, GUSD_

### Crypto-Backed Stablecoins

****

Crypto-backed stablecoins are exactly what they sound like; stablecoins backed by other cryptocurrencies. Crypto-backed stablecoins typically require users to deposit crypto assets of greater value, and require users to be over-collateralized in order to maintain a $1 peg.

##### Advantages

Crypto-backed stablecoins offer levels of decentralization that fiat-backed stablecoins cannot.

##### Disadvantages

Crypto-backed stablecoins are only as good as the underlying collateral that backs them and the protocol that issues them. If a protocol is unable to ensure that crypto-backed stablecoins are properly over-collateralized at all times, the crypto-backed stablecoins issued by the protocol may lose their peg. High levels of over-collateralization are typically needed in order for crypto-backed stablecoins to be issued in order to protect the peg during times of extreme market volatility.

##### Examples

_DAI, MIM_

::: tab Commodity-Backed

### Commodity-Backed Stablecoins

****

Commodity-backed stablecoins are similar to fiat-backed stablecoins, except they are pegged to a commodity rather than a fiat currency, and thus issuers maintain reserves of commodities. Since commodities fluctuate in value, commodity-backed stablecoins also fluctuate.

##### Advantages

Commodity-backed stablecoins allow users to gain exposure to key commodities while offering the same fungibility as other cryptos. Commodity-backed stablecoins allow users to transact with commodities in ways that are not possible through legacy markets.

##### Disadvantages

Just like with fiat-backed stablecoins, centralized entities are typically needed to issue commodity-backed stablecoins and manage the reserves in order to ensure that one stablecoin can be redeemed for one unit of the commodity.

##### Examples

_PAXG, XAUT_

::: tab Algorithmic

### Algorithmic Stablecoins

****

Algorithmic stablecoins are unbacked or partially backed by other crypto-assets. They use algorithms to maintain their peg, which often involve the minting and burning of tokens based on the demand and value of the circulating stablecoin driven by economic incentives determined by their on-chain algorithms.

##### Advantages

Algorithmic stablecoins are decentralized and may not require significant levels of over-collateralization to be issued.

##### Disadvantages

Since algorithmic stablecoins are unbacked or partially backed, they are more susceptible to a de-peg than other types of stablecoins during market turmoil.

##### Examples

_FEI, UST, AMPL_

## Utility Tokens

Utility tokens are tokens that are used to access a specific web3 product or service.

In real life people typically buy general admission tickets that are exchanged for access to all sorts of organized events. In video games players often have the ability to earn or purchase in-game "currencies" that can be used to acquire in game items or experiences. In crypto people must earn or purchase utility tokens to transact on a specific network or use a unique application.

## Governance Tokens

Governance tokens represent control over of a network or application. Governance tokens allow networks and applications to widely distribute decision-making capabilities to their communities.&#x20;

Big tech companies are often critiqued for exploiting their users in an effort to earn more money for their investors. This is because users and investors are not well aligned since one directly profits off of the other.&#x20;

Governance tokens are typically distributed amongst users, contributors, and investors in order to better align the decision making process with the interests of all stakeholders.&#x20;
