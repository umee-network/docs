# What is a Crypto Wallet?

![](/bg/what-is-a-crypto-wallet.png)

A crypto wallet is a tool used to interact with blockchains and the web3 applications built on top. Crypto wallets allow users to have full control over their crypto assets, without the need for a trusted third party. Crypto wallets exist in many forms, and are most commonly accessed through browser extensions and mobile applications.

## What is a wallet address?

Every crypto wallet has a **wallet address**, a unique string of letters and numbers that can be used to identify the specific wallet and the funds associated with it. Wallet addresses are publicly viewable, and can be thought of as your unique “username” when interacting with blockchain networks and web3 applications.

## What are private keys?

Crypto wallets do not actually store crypto, but rather provide users with a simple interface to view their crypto while storing the users’ “private keys.” **Private keys** are often described as an ultra-secret password needed to access funds and approve transactions on a blockchain, though it's important for all users to know that unlike other passwords private keys cannot simply be reset if lost or breached. Private keys are often represented as a 12 or 24 word phrase commonly referred to as a “seed phrase” or “recovery phrase."&#x20;
