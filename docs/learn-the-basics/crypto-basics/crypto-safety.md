# Crypto Safety

Since [blockchains](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain) are permissionless, no single person's transactions can be blocked or censored without a network wide consensus being reached. While this decentralized and trustless system makes it more easily accessible for people all over the world, it also attracts bad actors who will attempt to scam newcomers and take advantage of these irreversible and permissionless transactions.

## Essential Safety Practices

- Never share your seed phrase or mnemonic with anyone for any reason;
- Never enter your seed phrase or mnemonic anywhere;
- Never engage with unknown links that are shared with you;
- Never screen share with a stranger;
- Never sign unknown transactions;
- Use a [hardware wallet](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-a-wallet.html#types-of-crypto-wallets) for extra security.

## What is a Seed Phrase?

When [setting up a crypto wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet) users are instructed to write down a 12 or 24 word “_seed phrase_” which represents their [private keys](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-a-wallet.html#what-are-private-keys) Users should think of their seed phrase as the private key to their vault that cannot be replaced if lost. It’s highly recommended that users manually write down their seed phrase, and store it somewhere safe.

> A seed phrase cannot simply be reset if lost. Only you have the seed phrase to your own wallet — this is what guarantees the self-sovereignty associated with crypto. Since only you have the key to your vault, only you can allow assets to be transferred out of your vault. If you lose the key to your vault, you will be locked out and unable to reopen it.

It's incredibly important that crypto users do not share or input their seed phrases anywhere. If you suspect someone else has gained access to your seed phrase you should create a new wallet and transfer all of your assets as soon as possible. **The only instance in which crypto users will ever need to enter their seed phrases anywhere is if they are restoring their wallet on a new device.**
