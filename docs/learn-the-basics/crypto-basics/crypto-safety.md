# Crypto Safety

Since [blockchains](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain) are permissionless, no single person's transactions can be blocked or censored without a network wide consensus being reached. While this decentralized and trustless system makes it more easily accessible for people all over the world, it also attracts bad actors who will attempt to scam newcomers and take advantage of these irreversible and permissionless transactions.

## What is a Seed Phrase?

When [setting up a crypto wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet) users are instructed to write down a 12 or 24 word “_seed phrase_” which represents their [private keys](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-a-wallet.html#what-are-private-keys) Users should think of their seed phrase as the private key to their vault that cannot be replaced if lost. It’s highly recommended that users manually write down their seed phrase, and store it somewhere safe.

> A seed phrase cannot be reset if lost. If you lose your seed phrase you will be unable to recover the wallet it is associated with.

It's incredibly important that crypto users do not share or input their seed phrases anywhere. If you suspect someone else has gained access to your seed phrase you should create a new wallet and transfer all of your assets as soon as possible. **The only instance in which crypto users will ever need to enter their seed phrases anywhere is if they are restoring their wallet on a new device.**
