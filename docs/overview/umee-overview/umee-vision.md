# Vision

****

Umee is the first borrowing and lending platform aimed at offering universal cross-chain DeFi functionality that combines the strengths of blockchain architecture with the fundamentals of traditional debt markets. Umee will replicate the $200 trillion global debt capital markets using open source code, crypto primitives and web3 technology, constructing a universal yield curve and enabling a foundation for a modern monetary policy that is globally unified, transparent and decentralized.

### Foundation of a Web3 Native Debt Market

****

**Umee combines traditional debt market fundamentals with the next generation capabilities of [blockchain technology](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain).**

#### Traditional debt market fundamentals will provide Umee with the basis to create:
- _A term structure that uses time-to-maturity and credit-worthiness to determine rates;_
- _The crypto format for debt primitives such as notes, bills, bonds, CDS, structured products, and other assets._

<br>

#### Umee's [web3](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-web3) architecture will enable:
- _Decentralization;_
- _Transparency;_
- _Immutability;_
- _PoS-based interest rates;_
- _Decentralized credit rating systems._

### Transforming Global Finance

****

**Umee’s platform is an engine for long term building and growth, and will be the linchpin for the transformation of global finance as traditional debt markets are fundamentally reborn in [Web3](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-web3).**

_At $200t, the global debt market is the largest financial market in the world. Umee’s web3 technology is capable of supporting the debt market without the risk, cost, and inefficiencies associated with centralized intermediaries. While web3 is currently short-term focused, bonds will help shift focus towards long term building and growth._
