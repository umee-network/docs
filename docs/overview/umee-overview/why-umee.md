### Legacy Debt Markets

****

<br>

<details><summary>Guarded Systems</summary>

_Billions of people around the world are unable to access debt markets as they do not meet the required profiles that the debt markets define as desirable business and thus are barred from accessing the biggest capital market in the world. Various new forms of debt platforms (e.g. peer-to-peer lending and social impacting investments) have emerged, but they suffer from very limited impact._

</details>

<br>

<details><summary>Lack of Transparency</summary>

_Legacy debt markets give participants little to no visibility on their processes. Major participants have shown they are willing to act recklessly with clients' funds (toxic lending, over-leveraging, etc.) while disclosing minimal details to clients. Not everyone has to play by the same rules and asymmetric information access gives the lending institutes unfair advantage and power in the market._

</details>

<br>

<details><summary>Principal-Agent Problem</summary>

_There is often a conflict of interest between clients who provide liquidity and the agents who act on their behalf. The client maintains ownership of the assets provided, and takes the risk of potential losses. Agents are generally incentivized to do whatever it takes to boost their commission or other form of personal gains with minimal to zero personal liability; this lack of proper alignment often results in decisions that are harmful for the client._

### DeFi Markets

****

<br>

<details><summary>Short-Term Focus</summary>

_Most existing DeFi markets are heavily short-term focused with unsustainable rates or unreliable expected returns for participants._

</details>

<br>

<details><summary>Speculation-Driven</summary>

_Existing DeFi markets are driven almost entirely by speculation. Yields don’t come from value add activities and rates aren’t properly reflective of risk. There is a lack of understanding of what the base rate (risk-free rate) should be and thus a lack of a term structure that uses credit-worthiness and duration to determine rates._

### Transforming Global Finance

**Umee’s platform is an engine for long term building and growth, and will be the linchpin for the transformation of global finance as traditional debt markets are fundamentally reborn in Web3.**

_At $200t, the global debt market is the largest financial market in the world. Umee’s web3 technology is capable of supporting the debt market without the risk, cost, and inefficiencies associated with centralized intermediaries. While web3 is currently short-term focused, bonds will help shift focus towards long term building and growth._
