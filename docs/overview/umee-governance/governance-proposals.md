### New Asset Listing Proposal Overview

****

Umee allows users to lend and borrow a wide variety of assets across chains in a trustless manner. Umee follows a formal listing process that allows the protocol to assess risk using a targeted framework that scrutinizes key risk areas including market risk (volume, volatility, market cap), centralization of asset, smart contract risk, etc. Project teams should provide as much of the relevant information as possible to help Umee make an informed decision.

## Foundation Spend Proposal

Foundation Spend Proposals are used to request funds from the community & ecosystem pools to be sent to a specific wallet address. How community pool and ecosystem pool funds are spent is entirely up to community governance decisions. 

**A few ways in which the funds might be spent include:**
- _Creating and funding various Umee DAOs;_
- _Liquidity mining incentives;_ 
- _Funding large scale community events;_
- _Grants to top contributors;_
- _Strategically acquiring crypto assets to gain voting power in key protocols;_ 
- _Burning mechanisms._

## Parameter Change Proposal

Whenever a change is being made to the protocol, a parameter change proposal needs to pass through the governance process. Parameter change proposals need to be carefully discussed, reviewed, and tested since they will be automatically executed once passed.

**Parameter change proposals can be made for altering things like:**
- _Inflation parameters;_
- _Staking parameters;_
- _Governance parameters;_
- _Distribution parameters;_
- _Slashing parameters._
