### New Asset Listing Proposal Overview

****

Umee allows users to lend and borrow a wide variety of assets across chains in a trustless manner. Adding more assets introduces more risk to the protocol, so it is important that anyone who wishes to propose a new asset on Umee has reviewed the asset risk documentation and is prepared to acknowledge:

- _The increased risk of insolvency that comes along with listing a new asset;_ 
- _Centralized asset risk;_
- _Magnified risks associated with collateral assets;_
- _Market diversification._

## Foundation Spend Proposal

Foundation Spend Proposals are used to request funds from the community & ecosystem pools to be sent to a specific wallet address. How community pool and ecosystem pool funds are spent is entirely up to community governance decisions. 

**A few ways in which the funds might be spent include:**
- _Creating and funding various Umee DAOs;_
- _Liquidity mining incentives;_ 
- _Funding large scale community events;_
- _Grants to top contributors;_
- _Strategically acquiring crypto assets to gain voting power in key protocols;_ 
- _Burning mechanisms._

## Parameter Change Proposal

Whenever a change is being made to the protocol, a parameter change proposal needs to pass through the governance process. Parameter change proposals need to be carefully discussed, reviewed, and tested since they will be automatically executed once passed.

**Parameter change proposals can be made for altering things like:**
- _Inflation parameters;_
- _Staking parameters;_
- _Governance parameters;_
- _Distribution parameters;_
- _Slashing parameters._
