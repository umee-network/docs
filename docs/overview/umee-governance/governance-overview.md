# Governance Overview

## What is Umee Governance?

Umee uses an on-chain governance structure where governance proposals are [voted on](/users/governance/voting) by community members who [stake UMEE](/users/staking-umee/staking-umee). When community members who stake their UMEE fail to vote before a deadline, their votes are inherited by the [validator](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator) they have delegated their stake to. 

Since Umee’s governance takes place on-chain, the results of votes are always visible by everyone. Additionally, votes on certain proposals other than text proposals can trigger on-chain events that can not be stopped by a single person or group of people including the Umee core team.

Umee aims to make the governance process as easy and accessible as possible. If you have any suggestions, please share them with the community in the #suggestions channel on the [Umee Discord server](https://discord.gg/umee).

## Code of Conduct

1. Community members should always be respectful of others and make an effort to understand opposing views. No one should ever feel afraid to voice their opinion in Umee’s governance channels. 
2. Community members should work together to provide constructive criticism and collaborate to filter out low effort proposals while improving valid proposals for the betterment of the network. 
3. Governance participants who breach this code of conduct are subject to temporary or permanent removal from Umee's governance channels.
