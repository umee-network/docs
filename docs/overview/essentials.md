## What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a specific type of database that is coordinated and distributed across an open and public network of computer systems, with a digital ever-growing list of data points connected to one another, which act as a decentralized public ledger.

The data that is added over time are structures called blocks. Blocks build one on top of another in chronological order and include a piece of information that links the data block to the previous block, creating a chain all the way back to the genesis block (the first block). Blockchain is the core underlying component of cryptocurrencies. 

Blockchain is considered one of the most disruptive technologies because its decentralized and trustless nature ensures that the truth of a state (facts, data, financial balances) is kept and maintained without relying on any centralized third party (centralized databases, financial institutions, or any authorities) that can be openly accessed by anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world.

## What's Unique About a Blockchain?

### Decentralized

Blockchains run on **decentralized** networks, meaning that transactions on each block are recorded across many computers world wide to ensure that the data cannot be altered. If the data were to be altered it would retroactively alter all subsequent blocks through a cryptographic function called **hashing** which would be impossible to implement in the current world.

### Trustless

Blockchains utilize a trustless system, meaning that users involved do not need to know or trust each other or a third party for the source of truth for the system to function. In a **trustless** system, no single entity has authority over the system.

### Accessible

**Accessibility** is one of the biggest differentiators for blockchain, allowing any person with an internet connection to have access to the market without any identification barriers that some may face with a centralized financial institution. This makes it much easier for two parties to exchange funds without the need for a trusted third party like a bank.

### Transparent

The transparency of cryptocurrencies and blockchain benefits both the regulators and companies; it simplifies and improves the auditing process for enterprises and provides a permanent record of all transactions. Anybody can gain access to all transactional data from a blockchain.

### Self-Sovereign

Lastly, self-sovereignty is a distinct property in crypto. It means having full ownership and control over things that belong to you, be it data, money, or access to services. In the traditional world, we are used to giving control to third party softwares to store and access our data, and we rely on third party intermediaries such as banks to facilitate transactions. In crypto, the underlying blockchain technology is built to give full sovereignty to the individuals and each individual is able to make the usual activities in a peer to peer or peer to protocol fashion facilitated by algorithms and smart contract code instead of a centralized intermediary; hence, the popular meme **“Be your own bank.”**

## What Is Cross Chain Technology?

Most existing blockchains are isolated from each other, making it difficult for them to interact and communicate with one another. Cross chain technology was designed to fix this problem. Cross chain technology avoids reliance on a centralized entity, therefore avoiding third party risk such as abrupt withdrawal halts or operational shutdowns, and gives users full custody of their crypto with the goal of facilitating a faster processing time at a lower transaction cost. This will make it easier for anyone with an internet connection to transact across different blockchain networks from anywhere in the world.

## What Is a Crypto Wallet?

A crypto wallet is a tool used to interact with blockchains and the web3 applications built on top. Crypto wallets allow users to have full control over their crypto assets, without the need for a trusted third party. Crypto wallets exist in many forms, and are most commonly accessed through browser extensions and mobile applications.

### What is a wallet address?

Every crypto wallet has a **wallet address**, a unique string of letters and numbers that can be used to identify the specific wallet and the funds associated with it. Wallet addresses are publicly viewable, and can be thought of as your unique “username” when interacting with blockchain networks and web3 applications.

### What are private keys? 

Crypto wallets do not actually store crypto, but rather provide users with a simple interface to view their crypto while storing the users’ “private keys.” **Private keys** are often described as an ultra-secret password needed to access funds and approve transactions on a blockchain, though it's important for all users to know that unlike other passwords private keys cannot simply be reset if lost or breached. Private keys are often represented as a 12 or 24 word phrase commonly referred to as a “seed phrase” or “recovery phrase."

> It is incredibly important that all crypto users write down their seed phrase and store it in a safe place before funding a crypto wallet.

> Only the owner of a crypto wallet can have the keys to a crypto wallet. If private keys are lost, the wallet and funds they are associated with cannot be recovered. If private keys are stolen, the thief will have access to all of the funds associated with the wallet.

## What Are Stablecoins?

Stablecoins are a form of crypto-asset that are intended to allow users to enjoy the benefits of crypto and web3 without having to deal with the volatility commonly associated with other cryptos. Stablecoins achieve their price stability by being pegged to or backed by a commodity or fiat currency, or using algorithmic economics to regulate demand and supply. Many popular stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, meaning that in theory they can always be redeemed by a user for $1 or $1 worth of another asset.

> Stablecoins can be classified based on their stability mechanism. The most common types of stablecoins are fiat-backed, commodity-backed, crypto-backed, and algorithmic.

### Fiat-Backed Stablecoins

Fiat-backed stablecoins aim to hold their pegs by maintaining reserves in fiat currencies. These stablecoins are commonly pegged to the US dollar due to its strength relative to other currencies.

### Advantages

Fiat-backed stablecoins are a popular choice among DeFi users because they have faith that they can redeem one fiat-backed stablecoin for one physical unit of the currency it represents at any time.

### Disadvantages

Centralized entities are needed to issue fiat-backed stablecoins and manage the reserves. This means that a fiat-backed stablecoin is only as good as the organization that issues it. These organizations may be targeted by authorities who wish to maintain full control over a currency, and/or be subject to banking regulations which other stablecoins may not be.

### Examples

USDT, USDC, BUSD, TUSD, GUSD

## Crypto-Backed Stablecoins

Crypto-backed stablecoins are exactly what they sound like; stablecoins backed by other cryptocurrencies. Crypto-backed stablecoins typically require users to deposit crypto assets of greater value, and require users to be over-collateralized in order to maintain a $1 peg.

### Advantages

Crypto-backed stablecoins offer levels of decentralization that fiat-backed stablecoins cannot.

### Disadvantages

Crypto-backed stablecoins are only as good as the underlying collateral that backs them and the protocol that issues them. If a protocol is unable to ensure that crypto-backed stablecoins are properly over-collateralized at all times, the crypto-backed stablecoins issued by the protocol may lose their peg. High levels of over-collateralization are typically needed in order for crypto-backed stablecoins to be issued in order to protect the peg during times of extreme market volatility.

### Examples

DAI, MIM

## Commodity-Backed Stablecoins

Commodity-backed stablecoins are similar to fiat-backed stablecoins, except they are pegged to a commodity rather than a fiat currency, and thus issuers maintain reserves of commodities. Since commodities fluctuate in value, commodity-backed stablecoins also fluctuate.

### Advantages

Commodity-backed stablecoins allow users to gain exposure to key commodities while offering the same fungibility as other cryptos. Commodity-backed stablecoins allow users to transact with commodities in ways that are not possible through legacy markets.

### Disadvantages

Just like with fiat-backed stablecoins, centralized entities are typically needed to issue commodity-backed stablecoins and manage the reserves in order to ensure that one stablecoin can be redeemed for one unit of the commodity.

### Examples

PAXG, XAUT

## Algorithmic Stablecoins

Algorithmic stablecoins are unbacked or partially backed by other crypto-assets. They use algorithms to maintain their peg, which often involve the minting and burning of tokens based on the demand and value of the circulating stablecoin driven by economic incentives determined by their on-chain algorithms.

### Advantages

Algorithmic stablecoins are decentralized and may not require significant levels of over-collateralization to be issued.

### Disadvantages

Since algorithmic stablecoins are unbacked or partially backed, they are more susceptible to a de-peg than other types of stablecoins during market turmoil.

### Examples

FEI, UST, AMPL

## What Is a DAO?

Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs for short, can be thought of as community owned and operated organizations that are native to the internet. Traditional organizations typically have a hierarchical structure with a few key people making decisions for the entire organization, while DAOs can allow all of their participants to submit and vote on proposals to be implemented.

In order to allow community contributors and investors to govern the organization, DAOs usually issue a governance token to represent voting power. The more governance tokens an individual holds, the greater his/her influence over the DAO is. Governance tokens should be widely distributed to dedicated community contributors in order to help make a DAO successful.
