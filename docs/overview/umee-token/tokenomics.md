# Tokenomics

**UMEE is the Umee blockchain’s native token. The main purpose of the UMEE token is to power the PoS consensus of the Umee blockchain while allowing the community to use and govern Umee and the applications built on top.**

<br>

## Supply

There is a total supply of **10 billion** UMEE tokens, uncapped, with an inflation and deflation mechanism in place to align the UMEE token distribution with long term Umee supporters over time.

::: tab Inflation

### Inflation

****

Umee's inflation schedule changes slowly based on a targeted staking participation rate. When the network reaches the targeted staking rate, the inflation rate will remain constant. When the network has more than the targeted staking rate, the inflation rate will decrease gradually until reaching **7%**, the floor inflation rate. When the network has less staked, the inflation rate will increase gradually until reaching **14%**, the ceiling inflation rate.

> The dynamic inflation rate and the staking mechanism of the Umee blockchain is the ultimate security mechanism that guarantees the security of the Umee network.

::: tab Deflation

### Deflation

****

Of the platform fees generated by the initial borrowing and lending functionality, [community governance](/users/governance/voting) can make decisions regarding buybacks and burns of UMEE tokens. Additional deflation of the token supply will occur via governance determined mechanisms.

In the future community governance can also make decisions related to the usage of the Community and Ecosystem portions of the tokens, such as additional burning mechanisms and plans for the Community and Ecosystem tokens, based on the future market practice and industry trends for the best long term development of Umee.
