## Token Utility

:::: tabs

::: tab Validator Infrastructure

### Validator Infrastructure

****

The Umee Blockchain is built on a network of validators that contribute Tendermint BFT consensus to the protocol. Tokens are bonded to validators that stake to provide Proof of Stake consensus to the network. Validators come from an open ecosystem of contributors and infrastructure providers. Tokens can also be delegated to validators by users to participate in the underlying consensus mechanism. This helps ensure the Umee network remains decentralized.

::: tab Network Fees

### Network Fees and Proof Of Stake Consensus

****

Network fees will be earned in the form of UMEE tokens by validator infrastructure providers.

> Similar to how ETH is used as a gas fee to pay for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, UMEE is used as a gas fee to pay for transactions on the Umee Blockchain.

Validators earn block rewards in the form of UMEE similar to how transaction fees are processed in native blockchain protocols.

::: tab Protocol Governance

### Protocol Governance

****

The native UMEE token is also a protocol governance token used to facilitate on-chain governance for the Umee Blockchain. The UMEE token, when staked, can be used to vote on protocol parameters and upgrades for improving functionality of the blockchain infrastructure. The UMEE token will also govern DeFi parameters of applications that sit on top, community grants, and future development.

## Token Format

![Native UMEE tokens are used across the Cosmos ecosystem, while ERC-20 UMEE tokens are used across the Ethereum ecosystem.](/bg/token-format.png)

Different blockchains typically use different versions of tokens. Most tokens can be used across blockchains if converted to the correct format. It’s important to know which type of tokens you are in possession of before interacting with any web3 applications.


> The UMEE token exists in two forms: a Cosmos native version (the native UMEE token) and an ERC-20 token version native to Ethereum. The two forms of UMEE tokens can be freely [converted to one another](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens).

::: tab Native UMEE Tokens

### Native UMEE Tokens

****

> Most Cosmos tokens like the native UMEE token are interoperable with other Cosmos blockchains by design. Cosmos ecosystem users can easily transfer tokens between chains in a fast and trustless manner.

_**The main purpose of the native UMEE token** is to participate in the PoS consensus mechanism to help secure the Umee blockchain and earn PoS staking yield, pay gas fees on the Umee blockchain to execute Umee’s cross chain DeFi transactions, and to be able to vote and participate in protocol governance decisions._

**You are in possession of the **_**native UMEE token**_** native to the Umee blockchain if any of the following are true:**

- Your tokens are stored in an Umee blockchain compatible wallet like Keplr.
- You purchased UMEE on a Cosmos-based decentralized exchange.
- You bridged UMEE from Ethereum to the Umee blockchain.

:::

::: tab ERC-20 UMEE Tokens

### ERC-20 UMEE Tokens

****

> ERC-20 tokens are not compatible with Cosmos blockchains unless converted to a Cosmos native format. Similarly, native Cosmos tokens are not compatible with Ethereum blockchains unless converted to an ERC-20 format.

_**The main purpose of the ERC-20 UMEE token** is to create a user-friendly experience for Umee to tap into the DeFi legos on Ethereum and allow  people to seamlessly access the UMEE token as an ERC-20 token and hold or trade it on centralized exchanges._

**You are in possession of the **_**ERC-20 UMEE token**_** native to the Ethereum blockchain if any of the following are true:**

- Your tokens are stored in an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.
- You purchased UMEE on an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.
- You bridged UMEE from the Umee blockchain to Ethereum.

## Tokenomics

**UMEE is the Umee blockchain’s native token. The main purpose of the UMEE token is to power the PoS consensus of the Umee blockchain while allowing the community to use and govern Umee and the applications built on top.**

:::: tabs

::: tab Supply

### Supply

****

There is a total supply of **10 billion** UMEE tokens, uncapped, with an inflation and deflation mechanism in place to align the UMEE token distribution with long term Umee supporters over time.

### Inflation

****

Umee's inflation schedule changes slowly based on a targeted staking participation rate. When the network reaches the targeted staking rate, the inflation rate will remain constant. When the network has more than the targeted staking rate, the inflation rate will decrease gradually until reaching **7%**, the floor inflation rate. When the network has less staked, the inflation rate will increase gradually until reaching **14%**, the ceiling inflation rate.

> The dynamic inflation rate and the staking mechanism of the Umee blockchain is the ultimate security mechanism that guarantees the security of the Umee network.

### Deflation

****

Of the platform fees generated by the initial borrowing and lending functionality, [community governance]() can make decisions regarding buybacks and burns of UMEE tokens. Additional deflation of the token supply will occur via governance determined mechanisms.

In the future community governance can also make decisions related to the usage of the Community and Ecosystem portions of the tokens, such as additional burning mechanisms and plans for the Community and Ecosystem tokens, based on the future market practice and industry trends for the best long term development of Umee.

::: tab Distribution & Release Schedule

### Distribution & Release Schedule

****

![UMEE Token Genesis Distribution](/bg/distribution-schedule.png)

![UMEE Token Release Schedule](/bg/distribution-schedule-2.png)

#### Community

**46%** of the genesis supply is reserved for the community. Umee community governance will determine how and when to distribute these tokens through various incentive and grant programs. DAOs can be set up through community votes in order to effectively lead and reward efforts of building sustainable value. All types of contributors can be eligible for community token incentives, including but not limited to technical contributors, community builders, educators, and liquidity providers.

_**7%** of the Community tokens are liquid at the TGE on or around February 15th, 2022; the majority of it is structured as a loan to the market makers of the UMEE tokens, and the rest will be distributed as community incentives to bootstrap the Umee network. The remaining **39%** of the tokens will be vested linearly for six years starting at the TGE._


#### Ecosystem

**9%** of the genesis supply is allocated for the ecosystem. Umee community governance will decide how to use these tokens to best incentivize developers to build on top of the Umee blockchain and further build out the ecosystem. These tokens may also be burned if the community chooses to do so.

_These tokens will be vested linearly for eight years starting at the TGE on or around February 15th, 2022._

#### Public Round

**5%** of the genesis supply goes to community members who participated in Umee’s public sale on Coinlist.

_These tokens will be vested linearly for eight to ten months depending on the sale option selected, starting at the TGE on or around February 15th, 2022._


#### Private Rounds

**14%** of the genesis supply is allocated to early investors who participated in one of Umee’s two private rounds.

_These tokens are subject to a six month cliff which will begin at the TGE on or around February 15th, 2022. After six months, **1%** of these tokens will be vested linearly for six months while the remaining **13%** will be vested linearly for eighteen months._

#### Team

**15%** of the genesis supply is reserved for the Umee team. These tokens will be used to help attract new talent and reward Umee team members for their work.
